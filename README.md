## Running the Backend Application

To run the backend application, follow these steps:

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

    ```bash
    $ cd Backend/python-backend
    ```

2. Once you're in the project directory, install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. You can do this by running the following command:

    ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. After installing the dependencies, you can then execute the backend application:

    ```bash
    $ python app.py
    ```

    This command will start the backend application. Depending on your project's structure and entry point, you may need to adjust the command accordingly.
